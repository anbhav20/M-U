# Security Checklist for Talk2Stranger

Before launching Talk2Stranger to the public, please review and implement these security measures to protect your users and comply with best practices.

## Critical Security Measures

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] Sanitize all chat messages to prevent XSS attacks
- [ ] Validate all input parameters from client side requests
- [ ] Implement length limits on messages (e.g., 1000 characters maximum)

### 2. Rate Limiting
- [ ] Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- [ ] Limit new connection attempts per IP address
- [ ] Implement cooldown periods for "Next" functionality

### 3. Content Moderation
- [ ] Add text filtering for offensive/inappropriate content
- [ ] Implement automated detection of harmful content
- [ ] Create a reporting system for users to flag inappropriate behavior

### 4. WebRTC Security
- [ ] Configure proper ICE servers (STUN/TURN) for reliable connections
- [ ] Ensure secure signaling for WebRTC connections
- [ ] Add timeout mechanisms for idle or broken connections

### 5. CORS & Access Control
- [ ] Update CORS settings to restrict to your domain(s) only
- [ ] Apply proper CSP (Content Security Policy) headers
- [ ] Remove wildcards (`*`) from allowed origins settings

## Privacy Requirements

### 1. User Data
- [ ] Minimize data collection (only collect what's necessary)
- [ ] Implement proper IP anonymization
- [ ] Set appropriate data retention periods

### 2. Legal Documentation
- [ ] Create a Privacy Policy explaining:
  - What information is collected (IP addresses, countries)
  - How it's used (for matching, etc.)
  - Data retention policies
  - User rights
- [ ] Develop Terms of Service covering:
  - Acceptable use guidelines
  - Prohibited behaviors
  - Age restrictions
  - Service limitations
  - Rights to terminate service

### 3. Consent Mechanisms
- [ ] Add consent banners for privacy policy
- [ ] Implement age verification measures
- [ ] Include clear warnings about potential inappropriate content

## Operational Security

### 1. Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection for unusual traffic patterns
- [ ] Create administrator alerts for potential abuse

### 2. Abuse Prevention
- [ ] Develop IP blocking capabilities for problematic users
- [ ] Implement "circuit breaker" patterns to prevent cascading failures
- [ ] Add connection throttling during high load

### 3. Infrastructure
- [ ] Ensure production environment variables are properly secured
- [ ] Configure automated security updates
- [ ] Set up regular backups of configuration

## Compliance Considerations

### 1. Age Restrictions
- [ ] Implement mechanisms to comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act)
- [ ] Add appropriate age verification or warnings

### 2. Regional Compliance
- [ ] Review GDPR requirements if serving European users
- [ ] Check compliance with CCPA if serving California residents
- [ ] Consider local regulations for real-time communication platforms

### 3. Accessibility
- [ ] Ensure interface meets WCAG accessibility guidelines
- [ ] Provide alternative means of communication where possible
- [ ] Add proper keyboard navigation support

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with the most critical security measures:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS configuration

2. Then implement privacy measures:
   - Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
   - Consent mechanisms
   - Data minimization practices

3. Finally, add moderation capabilities:
   - Text filtering
   - User reporting system
   - Administrative tools for monitoring
